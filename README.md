# GameOfLife

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician  John Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-play game, the evolution of the game is determined by the initial state of the matrix.
Its purpose is to demonstrate how life-like behaviors can emerge from very simple rules, the underlying principle of ecobiology.


Rules:
- A cell dies from loneliness if it has fewer than 2 neighboring cells
- A cell dies of overpopulation if it has more than 3 living cells nearby
- A cell becomes alive if it has 3 living cells nearby
- A cell remains alive if it has 2 or 3 living neighbors
